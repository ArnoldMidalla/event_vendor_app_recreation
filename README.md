# EventVendor Mobile

## Project Overview
EventVendor is a high-fidelity mobile application built with **React Native** and **Expo** designed to streamline the connection between event-goers and service providers. This platform allows users to discover local events, purchase tickets, and hire professional vendors (like caterers, DJs, and photographers) through a polished, intuitive interface. 🎫

The project prioritizes performance and user experience, utilizing **TypeScript** for type safety and **NativeWind** for consistent, modern styling. From dynamic event discovery to a multi-step vendor booking flow, EventVendor serves as a comprehensive hub for the event management ecosystem.

## Features
- **Discovery Engine**: Browse curated lists of upcoming events and top-rated vendors with advanced filtering for food, concerts, art, and more.
- **Dynamic Ticket Selection**: Interactive ticket purchasing experience using high-performance bottom sheets for selecting general, VIP, or backstage access.
- **Customizable Vendor Packages**: A multi-stage booking process allowing users to tailor services, such as selecting specific meal courses for catering packages.
- **Unified Messaging System**: An integrated chat interface for direct communication between users and vendors.
- **Digital Ticket Wallet**: Secure storage for purchased tickets featuring QR code generation for seamless event entry.
- **Advanced UI/UX**: Smooth transitions and feedback loops powered by **React Native Reanimated** and **Expo Blur**.

## Usage
The application is structured using **Expo Router** for file-based navigation, ensuring a clean and scalable routing architecture.

### Navigation Flow
- **Onboarding**: Users are greeted with a professional entry screen introducing the platform's core value proposition.
- **Home Dashboard**: The central hub for searching events/vendors, viewing promotions, and accessing quick links to categories.
- **Event Interaction**: Clicking an event opens a detailed view where users can read event details, check venue locations, and trigger the ticket selection modal.
- **Vendor Booking**: Users can navigate through a customization flow (`app/vendorCheckout/customPack/[id]`) to select services, followed by a secure checkout simulation.
- **Bookings & Favorites**: Dedicated sections to manage active orders and save preferred events or vendors for later.

### Component Architecture
The project utilizes a modular component strategy found in `/app/components`:
- `Backbar.tsx`: A reusable navigation header with verification badge support.
- `EventTicketStyle.tsx`: A specialized layout for rendering event tickets with a "punched" visual aesthetic.
- `ReuseEvents.tsx` & `ReuseVendors.tsx`: Standardized cards for consistent data display across the marketplace.
